## What is this?

Like a cockroach that survives nuclear disasters, great software systems are built to be resilient, fast-recovering, and nearly indestructible. This tool helps teams assess their survival capabilities using the four key DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics:

- **🚀 Deployment Frequency** - How often you deploy to production (elite cockroaches deploy on-demand!)
- **⚡ Lead Time for Changes** - Time from commit to production (speed and agility keep you alive!)
- **🏥 Mean Time to Recovery** - How quickly you bounce back from incidents (legendary recovery abilities!)
- **🛡️ Change Failure Rate** - Percentage of deployments causing issues (lower is better - be resilient!)

## Why DORA Metrics?

DORA metrics are industry-standard measurements backed by years of research. They help teams:
- Measure their survival rating (Elite, High, Medium, Low)
- Build nuclear-proof systems
- Identify vulnerabilities before disasters strike
- Track evolutionary progress over time

## Design Philosophy

Inspired by [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/) - a database built to survive anything. This calculator applies the same resilience mindset to your entire DevOps practice.

## Tech Stack

Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - no dependencies, no build process. Built to survive. Just open and use.
